# This workflow handles both automated and manual package publishing:
#
# AUTOMATED PUBLISHING (on push to main):
#   - Triggered automatically when changes are pushed to the main branch
#   - Uses release-please to create releases based on conventional commits
#   - Publishes packages to PyPI automatically when release PRs are merged
#
# MANUAL PUBLISHING (via workflow_dispatch):
#   - Can be triggered manually from the Actions tab
#   - Allows publishing a specific package to PyPI
#   - Supports dry-run mode
#
